# NewsFreak - Flutter Complete News App Wordpress

NewsFreak is a complete mobile app for both Android & iOS based on WordPress blog. You can convert your WordPress blog into a native Android and iOS App within a few hours. We have used Flutter from Google to build this entire application and used lots of animations to make this app user-friendly. It could be able to satisfy users with impressive UI design and smooth performance on both iOS and Android devices. We have also used Firebase Push Notification to send notifications to the user and also used Admob to earn through ads.
